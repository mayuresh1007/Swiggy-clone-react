## Config-driven UI
Config-driven UI is a software development approach that uses a configuration file to define the layout, styles, and other properties of a user interface. This approach makes it easier to customize the UI for different use cases or user groups, without the need for extensive coding.

In a config-driven UI, the configuration file is typically a JSON or YAML file. The file specifies the UI elements, their properties, and their relationships. The configuration file is then used by a UI framework to render the UI.
Here are some of the benefits of using config-driven UI:
Easier to customize: The UI can be easily customized by changing the configuration file. This makes it easy to create different versions of the UI for different use cases or user groups.
Improved maintainability: The configuration file can be used to document the UI and to track changes to the UI. This makes it easier to maintain the UI over time.
Reduced development time: The configuration file can be used to generate the UI automatically. This can reduce the development time required to create the UI.
